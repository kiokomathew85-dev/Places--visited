Description
Places You've Been is a JavaScript application that lets users keep track of all the destinations they’ve visited. Each place is represented as an object with properties like location, landmarks, season, and notes. The project demonstrates:

Object-oriented JavaScript using constructors and prototypes
Test-driven development (TDD) for reliable business logic
Modular, reusable code for scalable applications
This project focuses on functionality first, with potential for a fully interactive UI.
